# Partner Advisory Council Lightning Talk Landing Page

This repository contains a small WordPress theme used to host the PAC Lightning Talk landing page.

## Testing

The project uses Node's built-in test runner. To execute the tests run:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs `node --test` and validates a few theme files.
